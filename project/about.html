            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Pawty Time was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate cat owners who wanted to create a community where cats could come together and socialize. Our mission is to provide resources and support for cat owners looking to connect with other cat lovers and organize fun and stimulating activities for their furry friends.</p>
            <p>Whether you're a new cat owner looking for advice, or an experienced cat lover wanting to expand your pet's social circle, Pawty Time is the perfect place to connect with like-minded individuals and build lasting friendships.</p>
            <p>Our team is dedicated to promoting the health and happiness of cats everywhere, and we believe that socialization is key to achieving that goal. We're constantly working to improve our website and provide new and exciting ways for cats and their owners to connect and have fun.</p>
